Huffman Coding Compression Algorithm UNIT 6

Given a string S of distinct character size N and their corresponding frequency f[] i.e. character S[i[ has  f[i] frequency.

Your task is to build a Huffman tree to print all the Huffman codes in the preorder traversal of the tree.

S = "abcdef"

f[] = {5, 9, 12, 13, 16, 45}

Output:

   0   100   101   1100   1101   111
   
Explanation:

Huffman codes will be:

   f : 0
   
  c : 100
  
  d : 101
  
  a : 1100
  
  b : 1101
  
  e : 111
